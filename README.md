# Pix2Pix: Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks

## Overview
This project implements **Pix2Pix**, a Conditional Adversarial Network (cGAN) for **image-to-image translation** tasks using a Jupyter notebook. Pix2Pix is trained to learn a mapping between paired images, allowing it to convert one type of image (e.g., satellite images) into another (e.g., map images). This is useful for various applications such as style transfer, image restoration, and more.

## Features
- **Image-to-Image Translation**: Transforms images from one domain to another based on a paired dataset (input image and output image).
- **Generator & Discriminator**: Uses a generator (U-Net) to create realistic images and a discriminator (PatchGAN) to distinguish between real and fake images.
- **Adversarial Training**: The model is trained with adversarial loss and a reconstruction loss to optimize both the generator and discriminator.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:
- PyTorch 1.x+
- TorchVision
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- CUDA (for GPU acceleration)
